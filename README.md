# WTF?

Why is it so fucking hard? There're non-iPod MP3 players out there,
and it's okay to have music in iTunes. Yet all that 3rd party
android/wp8/whatever sync junkware tries to be iTunes replacement and
can't do one simple task - get songs out of existing playlists and put
them according to tags in AlbumArtist/Album/Song folder
structure. Skip files if exist already.

So this script does just that. And extracts album artwork into
cover.jpg too, to make rockbox happy (it can't extract artwork out of
M4A container anyway).

# How?

Tweak variables on top and run. Simple.
